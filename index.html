    &nbsp
    <br><br><br>

   <h4>For this assignment, you are tasked with developing a daily <br>
    practice of "code sketches." Rather than constructing a single <br>
    project, your goal is to allot daily time to exploring generative <br>
    art. With your assigned letter as your inspiration, create 21 code <br>
    “sketches” of that letter in p5 over the course of 3 weeks.

    <h1> Me of the Screen: Photos App </h1>
<head>
<br><br>

  &nbsp
  <h4>My idea was to track my use of the photos app. I spend a lot of time looking at my photos, <br>
     taking photos and curating my camera roll and albums. Quantitative data is my screen time, which photos/ how often. <br>
     Qualitative data is my aesthetic preferences and how I choose to curate my albums. Someone suggested doing colour <br>
      tones and measuring the colours I gravitate towards. </h4><br>

    <h4> I found myself gravitating towards warmer tones like red, yellow and orange. <br> 
      I spend most of my time curating albums of my art, photography and other peoples art. <br>
      I spend an average of 17-18 minutes a day on photos, and about 2 hours a week. <br>
      There were 3 days where I spent almost an hour looking at photos.

    <h2>Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h2>

  <br><br><br>
  <h4>Questions:</h4>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">1. The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic <br> 
    (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). <br>
    Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics <br> 
    and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? <br>
    Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? </P>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, <br> what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?</P>
  &nbsp
  <br><br><br>
  <h4 style="margin-left:3%; margin-right:3%;">Answer:</h4>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">1. In the programmed designer, John-Patrick Hartnett seems to be against the monopolization of design software that companies like apple and adobe are causing. It can be dangerous when one company has control over the whole design market. It allows the company to increase expenses with little repercussions since so many designers rely on the software. In Microsoft and the yeoman coders, Gavin Mueller has a similar stance. He is concerned about big companies like Microsoft buying out the competition. He also talks about the fight for open source code and the tech giant’s who fight against it. Although he is not against open source code, his is worried about the decline of craftsmanship in the field of coding. To sum it up, both authors are on the side of decentralization. The solution appears to be that designer/coders should learn how to work with other software and to stop relying on these tech giants. But I think it is also the responsibility of these companies to uphold ethical business standards.</P>
  &nbsp
  <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">2. Learning about design principles and aesthetics is equally as important to learning the programs. Knowing how to make something look visually interesting is crucially important in this field. Studying things like fine arts, colour theory, story telling and the elements of design will help us to communicate effectively through our design.</p>

  <h2>Reading Discussion II: Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst</h2>
  &nbsp

 <h4>Readings:</h4>

  &nbsp
  <br><br><br>
  <h4>Questions:</h4>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">1. What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? <br> 
    Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument <br>
     advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and <br>
      provide at least 1 example. </P>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">2.  What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, <br>
     and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, <br>
      to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).</P>
  &nbsp
  <br><br><br>
  <h4 style="margin-left:3%; margin-right:3%;">Answer:</h4>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">1. I think Lialina's definition of the universal user is accurate. Computers, for most people, are about finding a quicker, more efficient way of getting tasks done. I think that most people do prefer to have fewer clicks or even less choice if it means they can save time when engaging online. The modern "user" is busy and their computer is sort of a quicker means to an end for all the tasks they must complete in a day. This does not mean they aren’t able to understand computers fully or take a DIY approach like Schwulst is suggesting, maybe they just don’t want to. I agree that fewer clicks does not enrich creativity. I think understanding the mechanics can enrich creativity, but fewer clicks does mean quicker results, and time is very valuable. What I don't understand about Schwulst's argument is that platforms are most useful for spreading targeted content around. Algorithms are designed to keep you engaged which can be very bad in many cases. But, it can also be good when it comes to finding content you are interested in and connecting with like minded people. Platforms will assist you in building connections where as for websites, especially new ones, the only free way to create traction is through word of mouth. For example, when creating a space for displaying your design/art, a website will generate very little interaction on its own, but a platform will suggest your space/content to "users" that it thinks would be interested. </P>
  &nbsp
  <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">2. As much as I'd like to be an expert, I am definitely the universal user. Although I am interested in the mechanics of it, I see technology as a tool to help us with other things. I am looking for the most efficient way of completing a task. “User-level systems, [are] systems set up for people who are not thinking about computers but about the subject or activity the computer is supposed to help them with.” (Ted Nelson, Computer Lib/Dream Machines (Links to an external site.), Revised Edition 1987, p.9) The internet, at least for me, is about helping or entertaining people. Computers are like running water. As fun as it might be to go out in search of a stream, I'd rather just sit here and let the water come to me. Does that make me lazy? Yes, but aren’t we all? Isn’t that why we invented all this technology in the first place?</p>

  <h2>Reading Discussion III: Code, letters, logic, play</h2>
  &nbsp
 <br><br><br>
 
 <h4>Readings:</h4>

  <p><a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_importance_of_play">The Importance of Play</a></p>
  &nbsp
  <br><br><br>
  <h4>Question:</h4>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"> Van Rossum explores the visual, formal, and structural logic of older <br>
     programmatic-looking artworks (pre-computer) in order to remake in current <br>
      day languages (Python) and tools (Drawbot), because why not? By rethinking <br>
       these static artworks into motion that loops, JVR re-observes through the <br>
        lens of new tools and languages. The artwork takes on a new life, and can <br>
         delight in different ways. Find 1 example of design that you find fascinating <br>
          and are confused as to how it was made. Post a visual. Describe how you <br>
           think it was made. Then find out how it actually was, written in point form. <br>
            Make sure to cite! </P>
  &nbsp
  <br><br><br>
  <h4 style="margin-left:3%; margin-right:3%;">Answer:</h4>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">I found it very interesting how Van Rossum took type design from the past and revamped it using modern technologies. For example, the typeface Beowolf that he co-created with Erik van Blokland in 1989. (Math, Logic, Design? with Just van Rossum, Type@Cooper *time stamp- 4:50*) The concept was already advanced for its time, using code to slightly change how the font looked every time it was printed. Years later, Rossum took that typeface and put it into a video animation where the layers are moving and constantly changing. He does something similar with several other typeface’s. I like that he is able to take things from the past and apply coding to create something new. It was interesting to hear his explanations for how he did it. Some interactive design I found very interesting is the tumbling letters by google in their "game of the year". (https://gameoftheyear.withgoogle.com/) The words fall when you open the page, then, you are able to manipulate them on your own. The way they letters move around feels very natural and un-structured. But, of course lots of planning went into this. It is very difficult to guess how it was done based on my minimal coding knowledge. I assumed they used html as well as some kind of style sheet where they used transform to move the letters. As for the interactive aspect, I was unable to find out how it was programmed. But, I found a blog that explains how they did the whole falling aspect of the animation. (https://www.creativebloq.com/inspiration/css-animation-examples *example #5*) They used css, html and some javascript. In the article you can find an in-depth explanation as well as all the code they used. Here is a short, simplified list of steps:
<br><br>
    Create initial html page <br>
    The head will contain links to css style sheet and js file <br>
    The body will contain h1 tags <br>
    Create js file to contain animation classes <br>
    Create style sheet in css <br>
    Here you will manipulate the positions and use keyframes to transform letters</P>

  <h2>Reading Discussion IV: In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl</h2>
  &nbsp
 <br><br><br>
 
 <h4>Reading:</h4>
  &nbsp
  <p><a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective/">In Free Fall: A Thought Experiment on Vertical Perspective</a></p>
  &nbsp
  <br><br><br>
  <h4>Question:</h4>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;">Steyerl points to how aerial imagery and 3D-generated environments have altered <br>
     the way we conceive of time and space. Because what we see now regularly incorporates <br>
      views that can only be generated by machines, more specifically computers, she argues <br>
       that we live in a society of “hyperreal representations—not of space as it is, but <br>
        of space as we can make it—for better or worse” (26). What kinds of social or <br>
         cultural consequences do you think Steyerl is alluding to when she says <br>
          “for better or worse”? Provide an example. </P>
  &nbsp
  <br><br><br>
  <h4 style="margin-left:3%; margin-right:3%;">Answer:</h4>
  &nbsp
  <P style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Steyerl talks about how the progression of technology allows us to view, explore and create worlds that are not our own, but resemble the world we live in. Movies and video games create "hyperreal representations" by taking themes and concepts that exist in our world, and applying them to imaginary places and characters. Never before have humans been able to watch and exist in the fantasies that we have created virtually. What makes this so enjoyable is that we can participate in stories that are not our own, which are likely more exiting than our real lives. It is a momentary escape from reality. For some people, that momentary escape from reality consumes most of their lives. It is a big problem when our real lives can no longer compete with our virtual ones. People can lose touch with reality and not be able to relate to the world in a healthy way. The overconsumption of certain content like movies, social media, porn and video games gives the audience a skewed perception of real people and issues. It is very unhealthy when someone is constantly underwhelmed by the occurrences of their day to day life, imagining how it should be in their heads based on the way media presents it. For example, if certain video games and movies influence someone to join the army, they might be disillusioned from the realities of war. Movies and good story telling has a way of making us "realize" things we may have never otherwise considered. A somewhat relevant example of this the matrix, and simulation theory. Many people were heavily influenced by the matrix films, and thoroughly believe we are living in a simulation, without doing any further research on the theory. Content like this can be damaging because it taps in to our need to be "special" and to find answers to the complex uncertainties of modern day life. On the other hand, you could say it is good that it allowed us to consider something we may have otherwise looked past. Successful story telling can change our perspective sometimes more effectively than logic and facts. This can be good because we can tell stories to teach lessons, and create an emotional response from an audience, sometimes more powerful than the response to real world issues. (e.g. The Lorax) Fiction has a way of altering our perspective of truth. How we choose to use this can be for better or for worse.</P>
